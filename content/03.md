title: Aimed at Method to be Compliant with Universal Resolver

# 0. Background
I designed a DID Method [did:content](https://github.com/KataruInc/did-content-spec), and it was Merge'd.  
but currently [universal resolver](https://dev.uniresolver.io/) dose not resolve it.
I tried to solve an error that occurred in the Universal Resolver.

I can find is that it is `non-compliant` and `missing`.

# 1. Aiming for Valid DID Document
Check if the Schema is correct as a DID Document.  
https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-document-properties  
Universal Resolver has a useful Lint for checking DID Document.  
https://didlint.ownyourdata.eu/validate  

Here's a quick check  
`did:content:3SqTXtoMpiPeNo5vEP2p7yNGQUeCGjqW1wnctv8yaCWXojD29GYcUEo` 
![](/static/03/03-02.png)

I get `Verification Relationship is missing`.  
The `verification relationship` is a method that is used to link a DID subject to a verification method.
It includes `authentication` / `assertionMethod`.  
https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verification-relationship

Note: I didn't think it was necessary because there is only `id` in Required, but I wonder if it becomes Required when under certain conditions?ðŸ¤”

I added `authentication` / `assertionMethod` etc. and Lint stopped getting angry.

# 2. But not worked.
![](/static/03/03-04.png)
I search a code from Repository, wondering where this content is determined in the first place.
https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver-frontend/blob/18f7be728ecebbe75e6a5b2347194594571f02de/src/components/App.jsx

Then I found out that the popup is based on JSON data on the net.
https://identity.foundation/universal-resolver/result.json

```json
  ....
  "did:content": {
    "status": "no response",
    "identifiers": [
      {
        "did:content:3SqTXtoMpiPeNo5vEP2p7yNGQUeCGjqW1wnctv8yaCWXojD29GYcUEo": {
          "error": "no response",
          "duration": 62.026434094
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
```

If I trace the source of this JSON update, I can see what Validation is being violated.
The update was a periodic execution by CI(GitHub Actions).
https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/main/ci/did-lint-check/run.sh

GitHub Actions shows that there is indeed an error.
````
 X> invalid SHACL validation response
processing Did: did:content:3SqTXtoMpiPeNo5vEP2p7yNGQUeCGjqW1wnctv8yaCWXojD29GYcUEo 
````

Note: What does SHACL mean? I thought it might be this, but I guess not.
https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/

# 3. Look into did-status-generator.
At first, I pulled docker container `oydeu/did-status-generator:latest` which is used in CI, 
and read the Validation part in it.
(I found the source code here)
https://github.com/OwnYourData/didlint/blob/main/did_status_generator/status.rb

I found that accessing here causes a timeout ðŸ¤”
```shell
$ curl https://didlint.ownyourdata.eu/api/validate/did:content:3SqTXtoMpiPeNo5vEP2p7yNGQUeCGjqW1wnctv8yaCWXojD29GYcUEo
{"valid":false, "error": "time out"}
```

I dived into the implementation of ``https://didlint.ownyourdata.eu/api/validate/``,
What is Timeout?, it looks like ``dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/``.
https://github.com/OwnYourData/didlint/blob/05ba4758655eb7148cb57bbb80870aa10f2e5512/app/helpers/application_helper.rb#L28


```shell
$ curl https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:content:3SqTXtoMpiPeNo5vEP2p7yNGQUeCGjqW1wnctv8yaCWXojD29GYcUEo
<html>
<head><title>504 Gateway Time-out</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>504 Gateway Time-out</h1></center>
</body>
</html>
```

Oh I see!, certainly `https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/methods` is also `504 Gateway Timeout` today,  
so `https://dev.uniresolver.io/` itself is not working correctly.

# 4. Wait, wait

The `dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/*` API is down, so the lint is `non-compliant`.
It's Experimental, so I'll wait patiently.  
However, I have to make the DID Document more valid (I'm writing a Document in the atmosphere).

# 5. it works (mistake was found)
It worked, but I deleted something necessary in the context and got an Error.

*If you follow this Warning, you may get an error, so don't worry about it.

Notes on JSON-LD Context:.
'https://w3id.org/security/suites/secp256k1recovery-2020/v2' is
not yet listed as Verification Method Type in the DID Specification Registries

# 6. Compliant!

# 7. Extends

I designing DID-Methods `did:content` to manage content IDs independently of the platform.
